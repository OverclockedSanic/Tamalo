# Tamalo

A simple multiplayer card game written in Node. I used to play this game with my friends, but
once each of us moved to a different country, it became a lot more difficult to do so. Being
the nerd that I am, I decided to make it into an online web app.

I actually wrote this initially in JavaScript, and that old version is still running on my
server, but I realized that the code is a dumpster fire and I'd need to rewrite it to make it
more reliable. That's this version on this repo right here. It's written in TypeScript, and
still work in progress.
